# Ruby examples

These require the https://github.com/archiloque/rest-client[rest-client] and JSON gems

* get_status.rb -- obtain the system status via REST api
* link_walker.rb -- traverse through the resource tree by following links
* dump_inventory.rb -- list platforms along with their top-level servers
* transfer_metrics.rb -- shows how to transfer raw metrics data from RHQ to RHQ-Metrics


They all get their configuration of the RHQ server to use from `RHQ_config.rb`.
