== simple alert domain specific language 

This tiny project contains a simple DSL (internal) written in Scala language, so that it can be run on top of JVM.

== Dependencies

== Usage
For running the prepared demo App all is needed is:

 $ sbt run

This will define three simple alerts on your platform resource (assumes id +10001+). It assumes the RHQ server to be running. For interactive mode just type:

 $ sbt console

== Examples
First define the alerts:
[source, scala]
  val alert1 =
    define alert having {
      name -> "foo"
      description -> "test"
      priority -> HIGH
      enabled -> true
      conditions all(
        CONFIG CHANGED,
        AVAILABILITY STAYS DOWN FOR 1 HOUR
      )
      dampening -> (2 from 4 last evaluations)
    }
     
  val alert2 =
    define alert having {
      name -> "bar"
      priority -> LOW
      enabled -> false
      conditions any (AVAILABILITY GOES DOWN)
      dampening -> (2 consecutive evaluations)
    }
     
  val alert3 =
    define alert having {
      name -> "baz"
      conditions any(
        "viewProcessList" OPERATION HAS STATUS FAILURE,
        AVAILABILITY STAYS DOWN FOR 42 MINUTES
      )
      dampening -> (in last 25 minutes 3 times)
    }
  
  
Now create the defined alerts using async POST calls on REST endpoint
[source, scala]
  val futureAlert1: Future[Response] = server create alert1 on resource withId 10001
  val futureAlert2: Future[Response] = server create alert2 on resource withId 10001

The default hostname and credentials can be changed  
[source, scala]
  val myServer = server withHostName("http://localhost:7080") withCredentials("rhqAdmin", "rhqAdmin")
  val futureAlert3 = myServer create alert3 on resource withId 10001
